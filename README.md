# Tic-Tac-Toe
## Rules
- The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row. 
- You play on a three by three game board. 
- The first player is known as X and the second is O. 
- While the first player puts “X” in any one of the squares, and the second player will put an “O” in any square. 
- This process will continue until all the squares are filled with each player putting X and O alternatively. 
- The player who succeeds in creating a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal with three consecutive X or O on the grid wins. 
- X always goes first, and in the event that no one has three in a row, the stalemate is called a cat game.
